                        Primary key
                ==========================


Key : By the using of key we can get the the vale

A  Database store everything in Table 


Think we have a Table and we know some one name in this table we can get the another info 
by the using of the name 
So , we can say that name is key


Primary key ::
                Primary key is a unique vale of the field all value will be unique

Primary key ::
                Primary key is a unique vale of the field all value will be unique


Composite Primary key :
                if their is not a unique field in the table their we use two value form 
                different field to make  a unique key (csc111,Du) (csc111,Bup)

Foreign key:
            when we use the Primary key of another table to track the value their we called 
            Foreign key
